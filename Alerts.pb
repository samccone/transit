ÄThe Orange Line may experience minor delays due to the Oak Grove Rehabilitation Project. Additionally, night work will be performed Sep 4 - Oct 9.

Due to the Oak Grove Rehabilitation Project, it is necessary for the contractor to remove old concrete from the platform area. The method to be used is removal by water pressure (hydrodemolition).  For safety reasons, this work can only be performed at night after rush hours when ridership is lower. Hydrodemolition will begin on September 4 through October 9 from 8:30 p.m. through 4:30 a.m.  

Thank you for your cooperation as we work toward project completion at Oak Grove Station.
